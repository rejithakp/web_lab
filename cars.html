<h2>2. Sedan</h2>
<p style="color:red; font-size: 23px;">Out of the different types of cars, a sedan (US) or a saloon (UK) is traditionally defined as a car with four doors and a typical boot/ trunk. A slightly technical detail is that it usually features a 3-box configuration with each of the boxes categorically used for the engine, passenger, and cargo.<br>

<p style= font-size: 29px;">Roadsters are the type of cars that are popularly used for elevating one’s appearance rather than comfort. These are open-cars with a two-seater arrangement that has minimal weather protection. Also considered a simpler version of a convertible, this car doesn’t have any glass on the top or side areas of the vehicle. These are becoming quite popular in many countries nowadays.</p>
